1)
First we have 4 classes implement ILibrary interface
-AudioBook: ILibrary
-Book:
-DVD: 
-ReferenceBook:

=>This violate ISP
ISP states that a client should not be forced to depend interfaces they dont use

For example:
DVD class doesnt need pages{get; set;} or author{get; set}

2)
Cutting down ILibrary class

Every class has: LibraryId, Title properties
=> Keep only 2 property in ILibray class

Creat IBook interface: Author and Pages
=> this interface is inherited from ILibrary
