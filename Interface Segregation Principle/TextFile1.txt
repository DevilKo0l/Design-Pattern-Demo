1)
First we have 4 classes implement ILibrary interface
-AudioBook: ILibrary
-Book:
-DVD: 
-ReferenceBook:

=>This violate ISP
ISP states that a client should not be forced to depend interfaces they dont use

For example:
DVD class doesnt need pages{get; set;} or author{get; set}


2)
Cutting down ILibrary class

Find the common properties between the classes and keep it in ILibrary interface
=>Every class have: LibraryId, Title properties
=> Keep only 2 properties in ILibray class


Creat IBook interface and find out the unique properties for Book class 
Every book have: Author and Pages
=> this interface is inherited from ILibrary

Every item is borrowable so we need to create Iborrowable
IBorrowbale have: BorrowDate, Borrower, CheckOutDurationInDays, CheckIn, CheckOut, GetDueDate
=> IBook and audio book can be inherited from Iborrowable but not ReferenceBook
Because referencebook doesnt need checkout => if we apply IBorrowable to all class we violate ISP

We create IBorrowableBook which is implemented from IBorrowable and IBook
=> this interface is used to join IBorrowable and Ibook

Implement IBorrowableBook interface to Book class
=> Book class implement IBook, IBorrowable and ILibraryItem

create IAudioBook which is implement ILibraryItem
=> IAudioBook have RunTimeInMinutes method
