1)
First we have 4 classes implement ILibrary interface
-AudioBook: ILibrary
-Book:
-DVD: 
-ReferenceBook:

=>This violate ISP
ISP states that a client should not be forced to depend interfaces they dont use

For example:
DVD class doesnt need pages{get; set;} or author{get; set}


2)
Cutting down ILibrary class

Find the common properties between the classes and keep it in ILibrary interface
=>Every class have: LibraryId, Title properties
=> Keep only 2 properties in ILibray class


Creat IBook interface and find out the unique properties for Book class 
Every book have: Author and Pages
=> this interface is inherited from ILibrary

Every item is borrowable so we need to create Iborrowable
IBorrowbale have: BorrowDate, Borrower, CheckOutDurationInDays, CheckIn, CheckOut, GetDueDate
=> IBook and audio book can be inherited from Iborrowable but not ReferenceBook
Because referencebook doesnt need checkout => if we apply IBorrowable to all class we violate ISP

We create IBorrowableBook which is implemented from IBorrowable and IBook
=> this interface is used to join IBorrowable and Ibook

Implement IBorrowableBook interface to Book class
=> Book class implement IBook, IBorrowable and ILibraryItem

create IAudioBook which implement ILibraryItem
=> IAudioBook have RunTimeInMinutes method

creat IBorrowableAudiobook which implement IBorrowable and IAudiobook

Crate IDVD which implement ILibraryItem
=> IDVD have: runtime and list off actors
=> IAudioBook also have RunTimeInMintes method but it doesnt violate DRI principal dont repeat yourself
because they have nothing in common, they both have runtime but they are 2 different things

3)Why in DVD or AudioBook class we didnt implement directly IDVD and IBorrowable but we created IBorrowableDVD
to connect IDVD and IBorrowable

Because we can assess to all the information through IBorrowableDVD
IBorrowableDVD dvd = new DVD();
dvd can access both method in IDVD ,IBorrowable and ILibraryItem

But if DVD implment IDVD and IBorrowable separately we have to create 2 instance of 2 interface
